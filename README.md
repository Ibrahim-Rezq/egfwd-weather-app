# Weather Journal App  

A simple web app to fetch and store weather data using **OpenWeather API**, built with **Express** for the backend and **vanilla JavaScript** for the frontend.  
Created as part of the FWD **Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
This project allows users to:  
- Fetch current weather data from OpenWeather API by city.  
- Save the weather entry to a backend server for later retrieval.  

It demonstrates a practical connection between frontend JavaScript and an Express backend.

---

## 💡 Learning Takeaways  
Working on this project helped me:  
- Understand **API consumption** in JavaScript using `fetch`.  
- Build a **frontend-backend integration** from scratch.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **Express** for handling server routes.  
- Learn how to store and retrieve data on a backend server.  
- Practice structuring a small but functional full-stack project.

## 🧩 Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – semantic markup  
- **CSS3** – custom styling with variables  
- **JavaScript** – frontend logic and API requests  
- **Node.js & Express** – backend server handling requests and storing data  
- **OpenWeather API** – external weather data source  

No frontend frameworks; all code is written in vanilla JavaScript for clarity and learning purposes.
